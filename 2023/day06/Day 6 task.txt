Read, write, execute and –

The ‘r’ means you can “read” the file’s contents.

The ‘w’ means you can “write”, or modify the file’s contents.

The ‘x’ means you can “execute” the file. This permission is given only if the file is a program.

If any of the “rwx” characters are replaced by a ‘-‘, then that permission has been revoked.

If the permission is given as 777 as per the below mode, then the user will have full access to the folder or file. This is not advisable if the user is not a root user.

Each of the three permissions are assigned to three defined categories of users. The categories are:

 "owner"   —   The owner of the file or  application.

"chown" is used to change the ownership permission of a file or directory.

 "group"   —   The group that owns the file or application.

"chgrp" is used to change the gropu permission of a file or directory.

 others  —   All users with access to the system. (outised the users are in a group)

 "chmod" is used to change the other users permissions of a file or directory.




ACL

ACL stands for Access Control Lists.

Think of a scenario in which a particular user is not a member of a group created by you but still, wants to give some read or write access, how can you do it without making the user a member of the group, here comes in picture Access Control Lists, ACL helps us to do this trick.

ACLs are used to make a flexible permission mechanism in Linux.


getfacl is the command to show what are permission assigned to any file/folder.

getfacl <file or foldername>


setfacl is the command used to grant permission to any file/folder.

setfacl [options] [-m permissions] [-x permissions] [file/directory name]


setfacl -m "u:user:permissions" /path/to/file

setfacl -m "g:group:permissions" /path/to/file
